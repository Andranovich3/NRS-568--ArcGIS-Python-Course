For this final challenge in NRS 568, I created a Python toolbox to be executed in ArcMap. This style of toolbox is much more

user friendly than a "traditional" style of toolbox because you can create the toolbox and all its parameters entirely in

a Python processing program, completely removing the need for a user to interact with a GUI in ArcMap and change anything.

This toolbox will contain three (3) tools, including a List Raster tool, a 10-meter Buffer tool, and an NDVI Calculator.

Example data to practice with is provided in the accompanying .zip file.
